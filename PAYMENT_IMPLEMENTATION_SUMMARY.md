## üîß API Endpoints Enhanced

### Payment Creation
- `POST /api/v1/payments/mada/intent` - Mada card payments
- `POST /api/v1/payments/stc-pay/intent` - STC Pay wallet payments
- Enhanced with fraud detection and security validation

### Webhook Handlers
- `POST /api/v1/payments/webhooks/mada` - Enhanced with security middleware
- `POST /api/v1/payments/webhooks/stc-pay` - Rate limiting and validation
- `POST /api/v1/payments/webhooks/stripe` - Comprehensive logging

### New Management Endpoints
- `POST /api/v1/payments/reconciliation/run` - Run payment reconciliation
- `GET /api/v1/payments/reconciliation/report` - Generate reconciliation reports
- `GET /api/v1/payments/fraud-detection/analyze/{order_id}` - Fraud analysis

### ZATCA Compliance
- `GET /api/v1/payments/invoices/{order_id}` - Retrieve compliant invoices

## üõ†Ô∏è Technical Fixes Applied

### Configuration & Dependencies
- Fixed `get_settings` import to use direct `settings` instance
- Added missing webhook secret configuration for Mada and STC Pay
- Fixed Pydantic v2 compatibility (`regex` ‚Üí `pattern`)
- Resolved SQLAlchemy metadata conflict in Payment model
- Added missing payment schemas for API compatibility

### Authentication & Models
- Created missing `get_current_tenant` function
- Fixed auth imports (`app.core.dependencies`, `app.core.tenant`)
- Updated model imports to use separate files (`orders.py`, `invoices.py`, `payments.py`)
- Added required dependencies (qrcode, pillow)

### Error Handling
- Comprehensive exception handling in all services
- Graceful degradation when external services unavailable
- Proper HTTP status codes for different error scenarios
- Detailed logging for monitoring and debugging

## üß™ Testing & Validation

### Comprehensive Test Suite
- Created `test_payment_services.py` with full service validation
- Tests all Saudi payment methods without database dependency
- Validates ZATCA compliance and QR code generation
- Confirms fraud detection and security services functionality
- Simulates complete payment flow integration

### Test Results
