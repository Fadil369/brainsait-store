# Security Implementation Guide

This document outlines the comprehensive security features implemented in the BrainSAIT Store application.

## üîê Security Features Overview

### Backend Security

#### 1. Input Validation and Sanitization
- **XSS Prevention**: All user inputs are validated against dangerous patterns
- **SQL Injection Protection**: Database queries are protected against injection attacks

#### 2. File Upload Security
- **File Type Validation**: Only allowed file types are accepted
- **Size Limits**: Files are limited to 10MB by default
- **Virus Scanning**: Basic pattern matching for malicious content
- **Secure Storage**: Files are stored with random names and access controls

#### 3. Authentication Security
- **Multi-Factor Authentication**: TOTP-based 2FA with QR codes
- **Account Lockout**: Protection against brute force attacks
- **Session Management**: Secure JWT tokens with refresh mechanisms
- **Password Security**: Strong password requirements and validation

#### 4. API Security
- **Rate Limiting**: Prevents abuse of API endpoints
- **Security Headers**: CSP, HSTS, XSS protection headers
- **Request Validation**: All API requests are validated for security threats

#### 5. Audit Logging
- **Comprehensive Logging**: All user actions and security events are logged
- **Security Monitoring**: Real-time detection of suspicious activities
- **Audit Trails**: Complete audit trails for compliance requirements

### Frontend Security

#### 1. Form Validation
- **Zod Schemas**: Comprehensive validation using Zod library
- **XSS Prevention**: Client-side input sanitization
- **Type Safety**: TypeScript ensures type safety

#### 2. Session Security
- **Automatic Timeout**: Sessions expire after inactivity
- **Activity Tracking**: User activity is monitored
- **Secure Storage**: Tokens are stored securely

#### 3. CSP Support
- **Content Security Policy**: Prevents XSS and injection attacks
- **Nonce Support**: Secure inline script execution

## üõ† Usage Examples

### Backend API Security

```python
from app.services.audit import audit_service
from app.core.security import validate_input_security

# Log security events
await audit_service.log_security_event(
    event_type="suspicious_activity",
    title="Multiple failed login attempts",
    severity="high",
    user_id=user_id,
    ip_address=request.client.host
)

# Validate user input
safe_input = validate_input_security(user_input, "field_name")
```

### Frontend Form Validation

```typescript
import { loginSchema } from '@/lib/validation';
import { useForm } from 'react-hook-form';
import { zodResolver } from '@hookform/resolvers/zod';

const form = useForm({
  resolver: zodResolver(loginSchema),
});
```

### File Upload Security

```python
from app.services.file_upload import file_upload_service

# Secure file upload
file_info = await file_upload_service.upload_file(
    file=uploaded_file,
    category="documents",
    allowed_types=["image", "document"],
    user_id=current_user.id,
    tenant_id=tenant_id
)
```

## üîß Configuration

### Environment Variables

```bash
# Security settings
SECRET_KEY=your-secret-key-here
MAX_FILE_SIZE=10485760  # 10MB
RATE_LIMIT_REQUESTS=100
RATE_LIMIT_WINDOW=60

# MFA settings
MFA_ISSUER_NAME="BrainSAIT Store"

# Session settings
ACCESS_TOKEN_EXPIRE_MINUTES=30
REFRESH_TOKEN_EXPIRE_DAYS=30
```

### Security Headers

The application automatically sets the following security headers:

- `X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff`
- `X-Frame-Options: DENY`
- `X-XSS-Protection: 1; mode=block`
- `Referrer-Policy: strict-origin-when-cross-origin`
- `Strict-Transport-Security: max-age=31536000; includeSubDomains`
- `Content-Security-Policy: ...`

## üìä Security Monitoring

### Audit Dashboard

Access the security dashboard at `/api/v1/security/dashboard` (admin only) to view:

- Recent security events
- Failed login attempts
- User activity patterns
- Risk scores and alerts

### Security Events

The system monitors and logs:

- Login attempts (successful and failed)
- File uploads and downloads
- Data access and exports
- Configuration changes
- Suspicious activities

## üö® Security Alerts

### Automatic Detection

The system automatically detects:

- Brute force attacks
- Unusual login patterns
- Malware uploads
- Suspicious IP activity
- Rate limit violations

### Response Actions

When threats are detected:

- Account lockouts for repeated failures
- IP blocking for suspicious activity
- Real-time alerts for critical events
- Audit log entries for all events

## üîí Compliance Features

### Data Protection

- **Input Validation**: Prevents data corruption and injection
- **Access Control**: Role-based access to sensitive data
- **Audit Trails**: Complete logging for compliance requirements
- **Data Encryption**: Sensitive data is encrypted at rest and in transit

### Privacy Protection

- **PII Detection**: Automatic detection of personally identifiable information
- **Data Anonymization**: Tools for data anonymization
- **Consent Management**: User consent tracking and management

## üß™ Testing Security

### Backend Tests

```bash
cd backend
python -c "from app.core.security import validate_input_security; print('‚úÖ Security working')"
```

### Frontend Tests

```bash
cd frontend
npm run type-check  # Validate TypeScript types
npm run lint        # Check for security issues
```

## üìö Security Best Practices

### For Developers

1. **Always validate inputs** on both client and server side
2. **Use parameterized queries** to prevent SQL injection
3. **Implement proper error handling** without exposing sensitive information
4. **Keep dependencies updated** to avoid known vulnerabilities
5. **Follow the principle of least privilege** for access control

### For Administrators

1. **Regularly review audit logs** for suspicious activities
2. **Monitor security dashboards** for real-time threats
3. **Keep the system updated** with latest security patches
4. **Implement backup and recovery procedures**
5. **Train users on security best practices**

## üÜò Security Incident Response

### In Case of Security Incident

1. **Immediate Actions**:
   - Identify and contain the threat
   - Preserve evidence and logs
   - Assess the impact and scope

2. **Investigation**:
   - Review audit logs and security events
   - Identify root cause and attack vector
   - Document findings and timeline

3. **Recovery**:
   - Implement fixes and patches
   - Monitor for continued threats
   - Update security measures as needed

4. **Post-Incident**:
   - Conduct lessons learned review
   - Update security procedures
   - Communicate with stakeholders
