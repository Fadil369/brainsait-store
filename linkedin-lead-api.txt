Warning
Deprecation Notice The Marketing Version 202407 (Marketing July 2024) has been sunset. We recommend that you migrate to the latest versioned APIs to avoid disruptions. See the Migration page for more details. If you haven’t yet migrated and have questions, submit a request on the LinkedIn Developer Support Portal.

LinkedIn Lead Forms make it easy for advertisers to collect leads through forms that LinkedIn members can submit. With Lead Forms, marketers can collect leads at much higher conversion rates. See LinkedIn Lead Forms and Lead Sync Ads for more information.
Besides lead syncing with Ads, LinkedIn also provides the ability to collect and sync leads through organic surfaces which would be distinguished by a leadType during lead syncing.
The following types of leads are supported for syncing:
Description
leadType
Sponsored - Leads collected directly from an ad.
SPONSORED
Event - Leads collected from an event page.
EVENT
Company - Leads collected from a company page.
COMPANY
Product - Leads collected from an organization's product page.
ORGANIZATION_PRODUCT
Note
This page documents the APIs required to build a Lead Sync integration. Developers supporting ads and Non-ads leads will be be able to use the same integration with correct set of permissions for lead syncing.
The following APIs are designed to support Lead Forms:
		leadForms - Get or find Lead Forms that will appear on LinkedIn.
		leadFormResponses - Fetch Lead Form responses.
		leadNotifications - Create webhook subscriptions to be notified of Lead Form responses.
Permissions
Lead Sync API is a separate program and access to the Advertising API does not automatically grant you the access. You must apply separately to be considered for Lead Sync APIs.

Creating Lead Forms
Currently, only ad forms can be created (creation of non sponsored forms is not supported yet). When setting the locale for an Ads Form, note that non-English forms can only be used for campaigns targeting that language, but English forms can be used with any campaign.

}
A successful response returns a 201 Created HTTP status code and the ID of the form in the x-restli-id response header.
Custom Text Questions
Free form text questions can be included in forms. The response lengths must be between 1 and 300 characters.
{
    "name": "customTextQuestion",
    "question": "I have a text question for you!  ?",
    "typeSpecificQuestionDetails": {
        "com.linkedin.ads.TextQuestionDetails": {}
    }
}
Custom Multiple Choice Question
Multiple choice questions can be included in forms. These questions require a minimum of 2 options. They can have up to 15 options.
The following example creates an multiple choice question with 2 options.
Sample Request
{
	"question": {
		"localized": {
			"en_US": "Are you interested"
		}
	},
	"name": "Custom question 0",
	"questionDetails": {
		"multipleChoiceQuestionDetails": {
			"options": [{
					"text": {
						"localized": {

						"localized": {
							"en_US": "No"

					}
				}
			]
		}
	}
}
Updating Lead Forms
You can update sponsored forms while they are in two states: pre-published and published.
Note
Non sponsored forms don't support edits.
Pre-Published State
An Ad Form is in a pre-published state when one of the following conditions is met:
		Form is in DRAFT status.
		Form is not linked to an Ad Creative.
		Form is only linked to Ad Creatives that are part of DRAFT Ad Campaigns.
In this state, you can update all fields in the form.
Important
Advertisers may have linked their forms to 3rd-party applications such as CRM or Marketing Automation tools. Editing a form after its schema has been ingested into the 3rd-party application may break ingestion of lead data. LinkedIn recommends warning users of this risk if your application allows editing of forms. Please advise the user to complete the following steps after editing:
	1	Delete previously created test leads synced to any 3rd-party partner applications they use.
	2	Re-map the form schema with the updated form fields in the 3rd-party application.
Published State
If an Ad Form does not meet the above conditions, it is in the published state. In this state, you can edit the following fields:
		headline
		description
		legalDisclaimer
		landingPageUrl
		privacyPageUrl
		thankYouMessage
		thankYouPageCta
		status
Sponsored Forms linked to Sponsored InMail and Conversation Ads cannot be edited in this state.
Sample Request
Make sure to set the Content-Type header to application/json.
		http
		curl
POST https://api.linkedin.com/rest/leadForms/656
{
    "patch": {
        "$set": {
            "state": "ARCHIVED"
           
        }
    }
} 
A successful response returns a 204 No Content HTTP status code.
If the form is not in an editable state or you attempt to edit an uneditable field, you will receive a 400 Bad Request error.
Updating Form Status
Form status can be changed from PUBLISHED to ARCHIVED. This can be done using a partial update request. Note that the status change only affects whether the form and the associated creative gets served or not. Including the entire form body is not required to change status.
Note
When you perform an update, the header X-RestLi-Method must be included in the request and set to PARTIAL_UPDATE.
Sample Request
		http
		curl
POST https://api.linkedin.com/rest/leadForms/656
{
    "patch": {
        "$set": {
            "state": "ARCHIVED"
        }
    }
}

Test Leads
Test leads can be generated from the Campaign Manager UI. These leads can then be downloaded via the Lead Form Response API or UI. The testLead field on a response will be equal to true for test leads.
Note
Test leads currently cannot be generated for InMail campaigns with lead forms.
Deleting draft campaigns associated with test leads is not recommended. Test leads linked to a deleted campaign will still be downloadable, but the associated campaign will no longer be retrievable which may cause problems in some integrations.
More information on generating test leads is available in Sending a Test Lead in Campaign Manager.

FAQ
Q: What happens if I have multiple subscriptions under an owner?
A: We honor all subscriptions and will send push notifications for each valid subscription matching the context in which a lead was submitted/deleted.
Q: Why is my webhook invalid or why was it invalidated?
A: In most cases a webhook fails validation because it does not correctly return the HMAC-SHA256 encoding of the sent challenge code using the correct client secret. Please review the webhook documentation to ensure all steps are completed properly. Also, note that validation is ongoing and the webhook is challenged in a regular interval (~2 hours) so ensure no limitations are in place to prevent our service from calling the webhook.
Q: Which subscription flow should I implement?
A: While each option is serviceable, unless there is an explicit need to have unique webhook URLs on a per form or associated entity basis, we recommend creating subscriptions at the owner level. This simplifies subscription management in that only a single subscription needs to exist per owner.
Q: What happens if I create a subscription with both a form and an associated entity?
A: For a single subscription containing both a form and an associated entity, the behavior of our system is such that a notification is sent only when a lead is submitted that matches both the provided form and associated entity values.
Q: What content can I expect to be included in the notification payloads?
A: Please refer to the schema below:
